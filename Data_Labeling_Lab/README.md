The primary goal of this tutorial was to train a sentiment classifier (Positive vs. Negative) for tweets from the Sentiment140 dataset without using any hand-labeled training data.

Data Loading & Preparation: The Sentiment140 dataset was loaded using a custom function. The tweet text was cleaned to remove URLs, mentions, and punctuation, and the original labels (0 for negative, 4 for positive) were mapped to 0 and 1. The training set labels were hidden (set to -1) to simulate an unlabeled dataset.

Writing Labeling Functions (LFs): Several Labeling Functions (LFs) were defined using the @labeling_function decorator. These are programmatic heuristics that assign noisy labels (Positive, Negative, or Abstain). Examples included:

Keyword LFs: Checking for positive (love, happy) or negative (hate, sad) words.

Pattern LFs: Using regular expressions to find positive (:), :D) or negative (:() emoticons.

Heuristic LFs: Detecting negation patterns (like "not good").

Third-Party LFs: Using TextBlob's pre-trained sentiment polarity score.

Applying LFs & Analysis: The PandasLFApplier was used to apply the LFs to the cleaned training data, generating a label matrix (L_train). LFAnalysis provided statistics on LF coverage, overlaps, and conflicts. Initial debugging revealed zero coverage for emoticon LFs due to regex errors, which were corrected.

Using the Label Model: Snorkel's LabelModel was trained on the label matrix (L_train). It learned to estimate the accuracy and correlations of the LFs to produce probabilistic labels (probs_train) representing the model's confidence for each tweet being positive or negative. Data points that received no labels from any LF were filtered out.

Training the Final Classifier:

The cleaned tweet text was converted into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer (an upgrade from CountVectorizer), creating sparse matrices (X_train, X_test). An initial memory issue caused by converting the sparse matrix to dense (.toarray()) was resolved by keeping the matrix sparse.

The probabilistic labels (probs_train_filtered) were converted into hard labels (0 or 1) using probs_to_preds.

A LogisticRegression model was trained using these generated labels and TF-IDF features.

Evaluation: The trained LogisticRegression model achieved an accuracy of around 61.5% on the held-out test set after initial improvements, demonstrating the feasibility of training a classifier using only weak supervision. Further improvements were suggested by using better LFs and more advanced models like LSTMs.
